## What is this and for what

This is a script that allows you to download portable installers of programs from Adobe for macOS with different versions. This can help system administrators who need to install the same program from Adobe on several computers, as well as those people who do not want to use the latest version of programs from Creative Cloud.

## How to use it

1. For the script to work, the Creative Cloud application must be installed.

   - [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/download-install/kb/creative-cloud-desktop-app-download.html) for "offline" installer of Creative Cloud under "macOS | Alternative downloads"

2. For the script to work, Python 3 and XCode (or XCode components) must be installed

   - just run this command `xcode-select --install` in terminal to install it

3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Drovosek01/adobe-packager` or download files via your browser (and of course unpack archive with files)

4. In the Finder double click on the `ccdl.command` file and follow the prompts in the terminal. You can also run the installer in the terminal to have it install into `/Applications/Adobe\ Packager.command`. Note that it needs the folder from github to remain on your system when you installed it.

5. Be sure to keep your script updated by running `git pull` in the terminal where you have this cloned to.

## Known issues

- Unable to download the Adobe Acrobat installer
- When using a link to download a v5 xml file the script crashes

## To Do

- [ ] Find a way to download Adobe Acrobat
- [ ] Fix the script for downloading applications via xml v5
- [ ] Find the difference between xml v5 and v4
- [✅] Refactoring the script - split it into different files
- [ ] Make the script fully or partially cross-platform
- [✅] Make it possible to download all the language packs and select the language of the program during installation
- [ ] Make interactive examples of requests for downloading an xml file in the browser

P.S.
At the moment, I do not know the Python language, but I will learn it sometime and maybe do scheduled tasks. Help is always welcome.
